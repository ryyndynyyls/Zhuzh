## Minor Fixes Needed (4 icons) ⚠️

### Settings
**Issue:** Current design is a sun/dial pattern, not a traditional gear.
**Preference:** Could you try a classic 6-tooth gear? Think: outer ring with rectangular teeth, inner circle.
**Alternative:** If the sun pattern is intentional for "simple/modern," I'll accept it — just confirm.

### Hours
**Issue:** The "h" letterform appendage is creative but might be confusing at small sizes.
**Suggestion:** Just use the clock with maybe a small indicator (dot at 3 o'clock position?) to differentiate from "pending"
**Alternative:** Accept as-is if you think the "h" reads well at 16px.

### Manager
**Issue:** Person body starts at `x=2`, violating 2px padding (should be `x=3` minimum).
**Fix:** Shift entire icon right by 1px, or scale down slightly.

### Holiday
**Issue:** Sparkle extends to `x=22`, outside the viewBox (0-24).
**Fix:** Move sparkle to `x=18-20` range (shift left by 2px).

### Meeting
**Issue:** Left bubble extends to `x=2`.
**Fix:** Shift left bubble right by 1px (start at `x=3`).

Just send the corrected SVG code for:
1. Settings (confirm sun or provide gear)
2. Hours (confirm "h" or provide clock variant)
3. Manager (shift right 1px)
4. Holiday (move sparkle to x=18-20)
5. Meeting (shift left bubble right 1px)

Then we're done! ✨
