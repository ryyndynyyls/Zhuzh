## Meta-Prompt: Planning Asset Generation for Zhuzh

I need to generate brand assets for a new app called **Zhuzh** (a timesheet confirmation tool). Before we start generating, I want your advice on the best execution approach.

### What I Need

**1. Custom Icon Set (28 icons)**
- Outlined style, 2px stroke, 24×24
- Consistent visual language across all icons
- Subtle sparkle motif on key icons
- Output: Production-ready SVG files

**2. Sparkle Micro-Animations (3 animations)**
- Success burst (600ms, exploding sparkles)
- Loading pulse (1000ms loop)
- Hover micro (300ms, subtle)
- Output: CSS keyframes or Lottie or React code

### Brand Colors
- Orange: #FF8731 (primary)
- Yellow: #FFF845 (accent)
- Lime: #80FF9C (success)
- Dark: #33332F (text/default icons)

### My Questions

1. **What's your recommended approach for the icon set?**
   - Generate as code (SVG paths) vs. generate images and trace?
   - One at a time vs. batches vs. all at once?
   - How do we maintain consistency across 28 icons?

2. **What tool/mode in AI Studio works best for this?**
   - Standard chat with code output?
   - Image generation mode?
   - Something else?

3. **For the animations, what format do you recommend?**
   - CSS @keyframes (simple, universal)
   - Lottie JSON (richer, but more complex)
   - React component with Framer Motion
   - Something else?

4. **What's a good workflow for iteration?**
   - Generate a sample batch first for approval?
   - Create a "template" icon then derive the rest?
   - Full generation then review?

5. **Any gotchas I should know about?**
   - Common issues with AI-generated icons?
   - Things that tend to break consistency?

### Context

- This is for a React + MUI web app
- Also has a Slack bot integration
- Target audience: Creative agency employees (design-savvy)
- Vibe: Warm, professional, playful, efficient

**Please give me your recommendations before we start generating anything.** I want to understand the best approach so we can work efficiently.
