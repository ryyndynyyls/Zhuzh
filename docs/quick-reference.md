## The Core Loop We're Building

```
Producer allocates → Employee confirms → Manager approves → Dashboard updates
     (web)              (Slack DM)         (Slack/web)         (web)
```

## Key Pain Points We're Solving

1. External tool = forgotten → **Slack DMs**
2. No real-time visibility → **Live dashboard**
3. Rubber-stamping → **Flag when actual = planned**
4. Too late to course-correct → **Weekly approvals**
5. Hidden UI buttons → **One page, no hunting**

---

## Design Principles

1. Trust = Accuracy + Adoption + Auditability
2. One page, no hunting
3. Company-wide view first
4. Proactive, not reactive
5. Meet people where they are (Slack!)
6. Quick context, not drilling (project snippets)
7. LLM-assisted, not LLM-dependent
